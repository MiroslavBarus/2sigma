2. EDA

3. Feature engineering for all of the algorithms

4. HPT for all of the algorithms, !!! at the bottom of the HPT files some of the algorithms have HPT even for the ensemble models
	- during the HPT out ouf fold predictions were generated to create final ensemble models, these files are not uploaded to GITHUB as they take up too much space

5. Ensembling- using averages and some of the algorithms, final ensemble model was created at the bottom of HPT_LGBM
